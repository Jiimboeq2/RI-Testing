RI Work In Progress Test Files

Place the files in InnerSpace\Scripts\RI\ZoneFiles

To call a quest in ZoneFiles simply type 'RI_Runinstances Quest-QuestName'

to call a quest in a sub folder type 'RI_Runinstances Quest-subFolderName/QuestName'


Note on testing files and experimental stuff(s) : You are likely going to encounter bugs, broken things, etc. if you are looking at testing to get what you can done faster 'cuz new files' you are in the very wrong business, feedback is always appreciated along with exact breaking points, what can be done to replicate the issue, quest name, step , what was supposed to happen vs what actually happened.  We appreciate any and all feedback, but the more specific you are, the more efficiently be able to help. We definitely have our work cut out ahead of us as a lot is being re-worked on the backend as well as new xpack stuff going down that's being blasted out as fast as humanly possible ðŸ™‚
