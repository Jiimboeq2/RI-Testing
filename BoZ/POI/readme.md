Download the Test Files and place them in InnerSpace\Scripts\RI\ZoneFiles folder.

To start a quest from ZoneFiles, type 'RI_Runinstances Quest-QuestName'.

To start a quest from a subfolder, type 'RI_Runinstances Quest-subFolderName/QuestName'

When using RQ if these are patched,  RQ will use from your zonefiles folder rather than the embedded version 

Testing new files and experimental stuff might result in bugs. Provide feedback with specific details such as quest name, command used, location (if needed), step of quest failure, expected results, actual outcome, messages displayed, and any additional information.
